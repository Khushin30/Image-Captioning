I've done some research into other options for fine tuning and decided to settle on LoRA for fine tuning. There is a very good explaination of it that I found here: [here](https://medium.com/@manindersingh120996/practical-guide-to-fine-tune-llms-with-lora-c835a99d7593) and another one [here](https://ai.plainenglish.io/understanding-low-rank-adaptation-lora-for-efficient-fine-tuning-of-large-language-models-082d223bb6db). The links also suggest that for fine tuning with LoRA we first must fine the modules we want to target and I've used the code provided by the first link in the cell below."

        "First r=8 defines the rank of the low-rank decomposition. Lowering this would mean less computation but less effective finetuning and increasing would have the complete opposite effect. Next alpha=32 is the influence that the adapted fine tuning weights should have over the original model. Finally I've chosen these target modules for where the resulting matrices should be made. From some internet research I've found that targeting the K, Q, and V projections in attention models is a common practice as it plays a major role in model influence. And that makes sense to me as any ML course I've taken that covers self-attention seems to dig deep on K, Q, and V. I've also decided to add output.dense which is the projection layer after self-attention. Fine-tuning it can help learn better attention outputs. I will be choosing to not add the mlp.fc1 and mlp.fc2 layers as those would require quite a lot of extra compute which I do not have."
